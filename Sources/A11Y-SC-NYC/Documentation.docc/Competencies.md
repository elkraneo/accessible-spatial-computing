### Essential

- [Get started with building apps for spatial computing](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023-10260) (31:55)

  Get ready to develop apps and games for visionOS! Discover the fundamental building blocks that make up spatial computing — windows, volumes, and spaces — and find out how you can use these elements to build engaging and immersive experiences.

- [Meet SwiftUI for spatial computing](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023-10109) (25:59)

  Take a tour of the solar system with us and explore SwiftUI for visionOS! Discover how you can build an entirely new universe of apps with windows, volumes, and spaces. We'll show you how to get started with SwiftUI on this platform as we build an astronomy app, add 3D content, and create a fully immersive experience to transport people to the stars.

- [Elevate your windowed app for spatial computing](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023-10110) (15:56)

    Discover how you can bring your multiplatform SwiftUI app to visionOS and the Shared Space. We'll show you how to add the visionOS destination to an existing app and view your app in the Simulator. Explore how your SwiftUI code automatically adapts to support the unique context and presentation of the visionOS platform. Learn how you can update custom views, improve your app's UI, and add features and controls specific to this platform.

### Transversal
- [Create accessible spatial experiences](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023-10034) (25:51)

    Learn how you can make spatial computing apps that work well for everyone. Like all Apple platforms, visionOS is designed for accessibility: We'll share how we've reimagined assistive technologies like VoiceOver and Pointer Control and designed features like Dwell Control to help people interact in the way that works best for them. Learn best practices for vision, motor, cognitive, and hearing accessibility and help everyone enjoy immersive experiences for visionOS.

- [Design for spatial user interfaces](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023-10076) (22:41)

    Learn how to design great interfaces for spatial computing apps. We'll share how your existing screen-based knowledge easily translates into creating great experiences for visionOS. Explore guidelines for UI components, materials, and typography and find out how you can design experiences that are familiar, legible, and easy to use.
  ![Design for spatial user interfaces](10076)

- [Principles of spatial design](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023-10072) (21:35)

    Discover the fundamentals of spatial design. Learn how to design with depth, scale, windows, and immersion, and apply best practices for creating comfortable, human-centered experiences that transform reality. Find out how you can use these spatial design principles to extend your existing app or bring a new idea to life.
