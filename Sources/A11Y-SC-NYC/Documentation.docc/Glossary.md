# Glossary
A list of terms used in visionOS

## Overview

A glossary is crucial in technical documentation for new platforms as it provides clear definitions of platform-specific terms, aids user understanding, minimizes confusion, promotes consistent communication, and empowers users to navigate the platform independently. It enhances clarity, reduces learning barriers, and supports effective communication within diverse teams.
